# RL Hockey Agent

This repository contains the implementation of DDPG algorithm designed for [HockeyEnv](https://github.com/martius-lab/laser-hockey-env).

This project was developed for the Reinforcement Learning course at the University of TÃ¼bingen in the SS23. This implementation was one of the entries from the RLcochet team for [the tournament](https://web.archive.org/web/20230813103929/http://al-hockey.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/), which was organized as a part of the aforementioned course.
